        <p>
          Clear Aligners are transparent plastic trays designed to gradually
          shift your teeth into their ideal positions. Unlike metal braces,
          these aligners are virtually invisible and can be easily removed for
          eating and cleaning. They have become increasingly popular due to
          their convenience, aesthetics, and effectiveness.

        <h1 className="text-3xl	py-4">Benefits of Clear Aligners</h1>
        <h2 className="text-2xl	pt-2.5 pb-1.5">Discreet Appearance</h2>

        <p>
          Unlike metal braces, clear aligners are virtually invisible. This
          makes them an excellent option for adults and teens who want to
          improve their smile without drawing attention to their treatment.
        </p> 
        <h2 className="text-2xl	pt-2.5 pb-1.5">Comfort</h2>

        <p>
          Made of smooth plastic, these aligners are more comfortable than
          traditional braces, which may have sharp wires or brackets.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl	pt-2.5 pb-1.5">Convenience</h2>

        <p>
          Clear aligners can be easily removed, making it much easier to eat,
          drink, and maintain good oral hygiene.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl	pt-2.5 pb-1.5">Customization</h2>

        <p>
          Each set of aligners is custom-made using 3D imaging technology to fit
          snugly over your teeth and guide them to their ideal position.
